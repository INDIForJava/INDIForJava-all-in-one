## The INDIForJava project

INDIForJava is a set of libraries (written in the Java programming language) to implement clients (graphical and not
graphical ones), drivers and servers that follow the [INDI distributed control protocol](https://www.indilib.org/), a
protocol designed to operate astronomical instrumentation.

The project is fully open-source and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/INDIForJava/INDIForJava).

## Intended Audience

The provided libraries are focused on the development of Drivers, Clients and Servers using the INDI protocol in the
Java programming language. If you are a regular software user, you are looking for a simple program to control your
astronomical devices and you don't know anything about drivers, programming, Java probably this page is not for you. Try
looking at [INDI Clients](https://indilib.org/individuals/indi-clients.html) for a list of programs that may be useful
for your purposes.

However, if you are a programmer and you want to start your own astronomical control program or you want to program a
driver for a particular astronomical device, this might be your starting point.

Please note that this libraries do not pretend to substitute or even replace the original INDI libraries which are still
used and actively developed. Moreover, this project does not pretend to mimic every single option that the original
libraries offer and, in fact, the programming ideas behind this library differ in some points to the original ones:
particularly, INDI for Java tries to provide a truly object oriented approach in the development of INDI compatible
software.

## Where do I start?

If you are interested in the project, you might want to check
the [repository](https://github.com/INDIForJava/INDIForJava) available for the project. There you have all the necessary
tools to begin developing you're own INDI Clients and Drivers: You'll find the source code for the library, the compiled
libraries (in .jar format), all the Java Docs for the libraries and even some example files to start experimenting.

It is also recommended that you check the original [INDI Library web page](http://indilib.org/) in which you will find
lots of information about the INDI protocol, the original INDI libraries (written in C and C++) and many more
resources (including a forum if you have questions or want to report errors) that might help you start developing your
own INDI related projects.

### Library modules

- `core`: the base library.
- `driver`: the module that represents an INDI driver.
- `client`: an INDI client module, which can connect to INDI servers and control drivers.
- `server`: an INDI server module, which can load drivers and connect to clients.
- `driver-telescope`: a telescope abstract driver.
- `driver-focuser`: a telescope abstract driver.
- `driver-ccd`: a telescope abstract driver.
- `driver-filterwheel`: a telescope abstract driver.
- `driver-raspberrypigpio`: an example driver that can control Raspberry Pi GPIOs.
- `driver-active-extension`: a driver extension used to create active drivers (drivers that can manage other drivers on
  the same server).
- `driver-serial-extension`: a driver extension that provides support for serial ports.
- `fits-utils`: an utility module which can be used together with the CCD module.
- `gnu-scientific-lib`: a Java port of the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), used internally
  in the telescope driver.
