 * CLOCKWISE from the observer's meridian. - Greenwich Hour Angle is measured
 * CLOCKWISE from the Greenwich meridian. - Azimuth (as in Altitude Azimuth
 * coordinate systems ) is often measured CLOCKWISE\n from north. But ESO FITS
 * (Clockwise from South) and SDSS FITS(Anticlockwise from South)\n have
