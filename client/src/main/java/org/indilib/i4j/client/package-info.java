/**
 * Provides the classes necessary to create INDI Clients, connections to INDI Servers and to inspect and modify INDI properties of Devices.
 * <p>
 * Usually a INDI Client will instantiate at least one <code>INDIServerConnection</code> to connect to a INDI Server. Additionally it can add some listeners to the INDI Devices,
 * INDI Properties or INDI Elements to be notified about changes in them. Additionally the values can be changed and those changes sent to the INDI Server.
 * Note that most of the other classes are not usually instantiated in a direct way.
 * <p>
 * Please check the examples module for some examples of the creation of simple Clients. If you want a sample Client with a Graphical UI, please check the
 * INDI for Java Client UI library.
